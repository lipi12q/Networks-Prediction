    "Mining a large social network to uncover how well homophily can predict identity as well as the network structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task2:** Attribute Prediction - most of the nodes in the social network are provided with one or more attributes that can be drawn from different types. (e.g., age, occupation, musical preference, etc. ) Predict the probabilities of attributes for a set of completely unlabeled nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `labeled-vertices.train.tsv` & `labeled-vertices.dev.tsv` & `unlabeled-verticies.test.tsv` \n",
    "   - users with attributes formatted as the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "   > - **vertex1** T1:3 T7:1 T4:2\n",
    "   > - **vertex2** T2:4\n",
    "   > - **vertex3** T4:3 T3:1\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Each value is specified as `AttributeType:Value`\n",
    "   - Not every user will have their attributes listed \n",
    "   - Majority users should have at least 2 attribute set\n",
    "2. `unlabeled-verticies.test.txt` - simply have list of vertices that should predict attributes and their values \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission \n",
    "\n",
    "**Attribute prediction** should be a csv file with two columns: id and attr. \n",
    "The attr column should contain a space-deliminted list of the attributes you think the user with that id has. The file should have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "> id, attr\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 123, T0:0 T1;1 \n"
